## Nonhomogeneous Equations

Now let's study an equation of the form

$$y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=f(x),$$

Where $f(x) \neq 0$. If it were $0$, then we could use our existing tools to solve it!

Call the left-hand side of the equation $L(x)$. 

**Remark.** $L(x)=0$ gives a homogenous ODE.

**Theorem.** The general solution of $L(y)=f$ is of the form $y=y_p+y_c$, where $y_c$ is the solution of $L(y)=0$ and $y_p$ is a particular solution of $L(y)=f$. We call $y_c$ the *complementary* solution.
