# Game Theory

While decision theory involved one agent and outcomes depended on these agent's choices as well as the environment, **Game Theory** involves decisions of other agents as playing an active role in determining outcomes. 

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

Consider two prisoners who each have the choice to either 

1. Admit to the crime
2. Claim innocence

Now the outcome of their sentences depends on both of their choices. We can sum it up in this table:
|||Prisoner 1||
|-|-|-|-|
|||Defect|Cooperate|
|Prisoner 2|Defect|3,3|25,1|
||Cooperate|1,25|10,10|

In other words, if both prisoners defect, they will each get 3 years in prison. We call this matrix the **Game Matrix**. 

The paradox is that the optimal solution would be to both defect, getting 3 years each. But this is not the conclusion reached by either prisoner, as they both believe it is always better to cooperate, no matter what the other prisoner does. So this optimal solution is never realized.
