## Decision Making

How do people *actually act* versus how people *should* act?

Although people *should* act by making rational decisions,  people actually act in a not necessarily rational manner. However, it is difficult to classify irrational behaviour as "good" or "bad". It is the case, however, that irrational behaviour is easier to exploit or manipulate.

### Factors influencing people's decisions

- Past experiences: When a decision in the past results in a good outcome, people are more likely to repeat similar behaviour in similar scenarios. They are also less likely to repeat past mistakes.

- Cognitive biases: On a psychological or physiological level, biases can affect our decision making.
    - Belief bias: overreliance on previous knowledge
    - Hindsight bias: when the event has occured already, people tend to justify their decision
    - Omission bias: people tend to omit or surpress information that has uncertainty or risk
    - Confirmation bias

$\newline$
- Escalation of commitment: people tend to invest unjustifiable amounts of resources to decisions that they have made in the past and feel comitted to. They may also feel pressured by the sunken cost.

- Belief in one's personal relevance: If people are doubtful of their own relevance, they may not feel as compelled to make a decision. For example, voters who think that one vote will not change anything may not vote.

It was discovered that people who had a damaged amygdala, the area in the brain responsible for emotions, had trouble making decisions, as they felt overwhelmed. We can note that many of our decisions are made based, to some extent, on emotions. If we actually took every rational consideration into account, we would be overwhelmed.
