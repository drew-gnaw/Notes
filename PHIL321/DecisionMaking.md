## Decision Making

How do people *actually act* versus how people *should* act?

Although people *should* act by making rational decisions,  people actually act in a not necessarily rational manner. However, it is difficult to classify irrational behaviour as "good" or "bad". It is the case, however, that irrational behaviour is easier to exploit or manipulate.

- Cognitive biases: On a psychological or physiological level, biases can affect our decision making.
