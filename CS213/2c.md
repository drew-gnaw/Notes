## Synchronization

We're gonna try and make the threads play nice and be productive with each other now!

At its core, we want to ensure `mutual exclusion` of `critial sections`. In other words, only one thread should access `shared` data at a time.

### Communicating in shared data

We can run into issues when threads share a data structure, and they access it simultaneously. Each thread's accesses can be arbitrarily interleaved!

A `critical section` is a chunk of code that access `shared data`.

When two threads access the same shared data, with at least one thread updating said data, this is a `race condition`. The resulting behaviour is unpredictable and a serious bug.

So we employ `Mutual Exclusion`, which is a software mechanism that uses hardware support. It ensures that `critical sections` are executed by one thread at a time.
