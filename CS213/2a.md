### I/O Devices 
---

Summary: The computer is MORE than just memory and CPU, and several things can happen simultaneously. 

In between the CPU and the memory, there is a data/control path called the Memory Bus.

I/O devices have assigned "memory" addresses, but dont actually exist in memory. However, we assign these addresses so that we can read/write to them in the same format we have been using.
