### I/O Devices 
---

Summary: The computer is MORE than just memory and CPU, and several things can happen simultaneously. 

In between the CPU and the memory, there is a data/control path called the Memory Bus.

I/O devices have assigned "memory" addresses, but dont actually exist in memory. However, we assign these addresses so that we can read/write to them in the same format we have been using.

The CPU can initiate communication with I/O devices using PIO. However, if we stick with this, then the CPU must constantly "poll" and see if the I/O device has finished yet. So we use "Interrupts", which allow the I/O device to interrupt the CPU and cause it to jump. 

The ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) are functions that are used to handle interrupts. They then return to the CPU when they are finished. ISRs are called using a `jump table`.

`Polling` is good when there is a high probability of a `hit`. For example, we would want to use `polling` for a clock, since there is always a time!
