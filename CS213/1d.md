### Static control flow

---

We all know control flow... but now... $\huge{\text{IN ASSEMBLY!}}$

Every program execution can be described by a linear set of instructions.

You cannot ++ a static array address!

### GOTO statements

```java
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    s += a[i];
}
```

can be translated to 

```java
        i = 0;
loop:   goto end_loop if not (1<n)
        s += a[i];
        i++;
        goto loop
end_loop: // rest
```
