## Notes

### Gameplay Design

---

- Main character's weapon of choice is a staff.

- Materials gained from organic beings that have been infected by the waste. The longer the organism has been infected, the stronger the enemy + more valuable the material.

- Gain permanent knowledge about specific monsters that you have fought, to enhance strategic play against them in the future.

- MC is gathering ordinary sludge for the Government, but the more valuable resources are being kept for themselves since the Government doesn't know about it

- a **REALLY** good wall

- Desert biome (out of consideration for the artists)

- Fast travel!!

- Have points on a map, and you can click where you want to go (Hotspots)

- Each hotspot carries gameplay such as sucking up the goop

- Weapons are equippable in the overworld, and you can 'ambush' enemies to gain some advantage in battle

- Goop with specific properties (such as healing) that would be the target of the vacuum. Combat around these kinds of goop would be affected by its properties (additional healing?)

- Quota for amount of goop collected OR force the player to place collecting machines in certain locations. Both of these scenarios force the player to explore the area sufficiently 

### Combat mechanics

---

- Attacks from enemies can be read depending on a stat called insight, allowing you to predict their moves, and choose your own accordingly

- Madness meter: MC is sick so they are getting stronger (more infected over time). 

- Possible weapons: Staff, Gun, Vacuum (on reverse mode)

- Some sort of resource that is refreshed over turns

- Weapon costs, buy from certain hotspots

### Demo Sequence

---

- Beginning sequence, short tutorial

- Training room, practice on dummy

- Time skip! (Accelerated gameplay) Could be accmploshed by having the player faint right away, and waking up in the rebel camp

-
