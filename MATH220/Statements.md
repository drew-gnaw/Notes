## Declarative sentences and statements

Here are some examples of a declarative sentence:

- A mathematical object $S$ has property $1$.
- If $S$ has property $1$, then $S$ has property $2$.
- There are no $S$ with property $1$.
- Cats are better than dogs.

In essence, a declarative sentence is a sentence that declares something. **Statements** are declarative sentences that we can assign a truth value to. The sentence "Cats are better than dogs" is not a statement.

It is possible that we might not know whether a statement is true or false, but we know that it is one of the two. They are still statements!

An **open sentence** is a sentence that depends on one or more parameters. If these parameters are supplied, then it becomes a statement.

We will now refer to statements using capital letters. For example, $P$, $Q$, $R$. Open sentences can be expressed as $P(x)$, $Q(x)$, $R(x)$. 

### Negation

We use $\sim P$ to denote the negation of P.

### Conjunction/Disjunction

We use $\land$ and $\lor$ to denote conjunction/disjunction.
