## Symbolic Logic

Let's try to express a statement using symbolic logic.

**Statement.** 1729 is not a cube, but it is the sum of two cubes.

Let $P: $ There does not exist $x \in \Z$ such that $x^3 = 1729$.

and $Q: $ These exist $a, b \in \Z$ such that $a^3 + b^3 = 1729$.

Then the statement can be written as $P \land Q$.


**Statement.** If an integer is divisible by $6$ or $10$, then it is divisible by $2$.

Let $P(n): n = 6k$ for $k \in \Z$.

and $Q(n): n = 10j$ for $j \in \Z$.

and $R(n): n = 2l$ for $l \in \Z$.

Then the statement can be written as $(P(n) \lor Q(n)) \rightarrow R(n)$.

### Modus ponens

Given the antecedent/hypothesis, conclude the consequent.

### Modus tollens

Given the negation of the consequent, conclude the negation of the antecedent.

### Contrapositive

Given $P \rightarrow Q$, we have $\sim Q \rightarrow \sim P$.

### Converse

The converse of an implication is the other direction of the arrow. They are not logically equivalent.

### Logical Equivalence

Two statements are logically equivalent iff their truth tables are the same. We use $\equiv$ for logical equivalence.

### Biconditional

The notation used is $P \leftrightarrow Q$.

### De Morgan's Laws

$\sim (P \lor Q) \equiv \sim P \land \sim Q\\$
$\sim (P \land Q) \equiv \sim P \lor \sim Q$.
